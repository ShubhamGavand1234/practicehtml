      <h3>Here's a time line of Mahatma's life:</h3>
      <p>
        1869 - Born at Porbandar, India 1883 - Got married to Kasturba Makhandas
        Kapadia at a young age of 13, as per the prevalent regional custom at
        that time. 1888 - Dropped out of college and left to study law at
        London. His family was against his decision to move to london for
        studying law. They feared that he would abandon his religion and family
        after going to Britain. But he dissuaded them by taking a vow that he
        would abstain from meat,alcohol and women during his stusies there. He
        kept his words. 1891 - Graduated as a Barrister from London and returned
        to India. Tried to establish a law business at the then Bombay for 2
        years but failed. 1893 - Went to South Africa to work as a lawyer for a
        shipping company. He spent 21 years in South Africa. This period turned
        out to be the turning point in his life. After suffering the atrocious
        racist regime first hand, he took up the cause of fellow Indians and
        tought them to fight back by using non-violent means.
